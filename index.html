        <h3>About:</h3>
        <p>
        I am currently a full-time Reservations Supervisor for Vail Resorts, but am studing Web Development at The University of Denver. I have wanted to learn how to code for a few years now and would love to put my skills to the test by designing and improving websites for small companies within the ski industry. Once I have completed this web development bootcamp, I would love to get to know you, so donâ€™t hesitate to get in touch.
        </p>
        <h3>Services:</h3>
        <h4>HTML</h4>
        <p>
        I have learned the basics of HTML and am feeling confident in my abilities to get text onto a website.
        </p>
        <h4>CSS</h4>
        <p>
        I am slowly but surely becoming quite knowledgable with the styling aspect of coding, CSS. I can make your website look exactly how you want it! 
        </p>
        <h4>JavaScript</h4>
        <p>
        I have just been introduced to the basics of JavaScript. This is what makes a website responsive. In a few weeks I will be much more confident with JavaScript skills.
