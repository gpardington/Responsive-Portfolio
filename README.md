# Responsive-Portfolio
This is my current portfolio. This is a constant work in progress, continuing to improve. I used Bootstrap to help me form the frameworks of the website including the navbar, the content grid, the portfolio gallery, and the contact form. I have linked my best coding work so far, my LinkedIn profile, my GitHub profile, and have included my most updated resume.
