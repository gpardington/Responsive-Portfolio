# Responsive-Portfolio
This is my 2nd homework assignment. It is my very first attempt at making a professional, responsive portfolio. I used Bootstrap to help me form the frameworks of the website including the navbar, the content grid, the portfolio gallery, the contact form, and the sticky footer. I used an HTML validation service to make sure that there weren't any issues with the markup validity.
